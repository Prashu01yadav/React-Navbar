# Project 4 with React

## React Router Dom - Navigation Bar
 This is a simple navigation bar in react.
> I have experimented this with `a` tag to visualize the loading effect it causes.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is advised to use `Link` tag instead of `a` tag, so that it does not cause the loading of pages, rather renders in the same page.

## Tech Stack
1. React
